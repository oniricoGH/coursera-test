JS

A variable is undefined if it is declared but not set to any specific value.

Strict equality : ===

4==‘4’ -> true
4===‘4’ -> false

Console: Boolean(something) -> evaluate a value

Semicolons always at the end

Functions are objects.

Primitives passed by value, objects passed by reference.

Function with this are constructors and are capitalized.
Function prototypes are defined out of the constructor. They are share by all objects for a certain object.

This inside an object or a constructor points to the created object.
Careful in inner functions: this could point to global (window) instead of to the object itself.

New object { x: 5}

for(var prop in myObj) -> prop is an index. Arrays are objects, then elements are properties and vice versa.

Variables declared on the main thread of any js file are always part of the global object. 

IIFE: (function(){})();
